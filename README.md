# Sudoku Puzzle Generator and Solver

This project is a Python-based Sudoku puzzle generator and solver. It can create Sudoku puzzles with unique solutions and solves them using a recursive backtracking method.

## Project Overview

The project consists of:
- **Generation**: Generates a complete, valid Sudoku grid and then removes numbers based on a chosen difficulty level to create a playable puzzle.
- **Verification**: Uses a backtracking algorithm to ensure that each puzzle has a unique solution.
- **Solving**: Uses the same backtracking algorithm to find the solution and prints it out.

## Running the Project

To use this project, run the `sudoku.py` file, which will generate and display a Sudoku puzzle based on the desired difficulty level. Ensure you have `generator.py` in the same directory, as it contains the main functions for puzzle generation and validation.
